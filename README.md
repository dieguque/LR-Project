# Movie Suggestion for Movie Studio
A movie studio contacted me to predict what characteristics their next succesful movie should have.


### Question/need
In this project I plan to suggest to a **movie studio** what movie to make using different inputs like *Genre, Actors, Lead actors, Projected size of budget, Writer, Adapted source (book/TV show, etc), and Release date (month/season/holiday/etc)* the goal is to predict what factors should include in the next sucessful movie and make a suggestion to the movie studio.


### Data Description:
I plan to build the dataset using data scrapping from [Box Office Mojo](http://boxofficemojo.com). After getting the dataset I plan to build a model that will help me to predict the characteristics the movie should have in order to be a succesful movie. 

### Tools:
Some necesary tools are Python and some packages like *Selenium, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn*.

### MVP Goal:
The **minimum viable product (MVP)** for this project will be to present three movie suggestion about the characteristics that a succesful movie should have based in our model.
